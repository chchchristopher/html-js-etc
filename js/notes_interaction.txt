Alert, Prompt, Confirm

The mini-window which appears like with alert(message); is called
a modal window
The user can't interact with the rest of the page until they've dealt with the
window. In alert()'s case, until they press OK. 

prompt: creates a modal window for user to enter input
- includes a default
- returns "null" if cancel is hit

confirm: creates a modal window with text and OK or Cancel
- OK returns true, Cancel returns false


With all of these:
- location of modal window is decided by browser, typically center
- style of modal window also decided by browser, can't change it

There are other ways of richer/interactive interactions with user
but these are the simplest ones
