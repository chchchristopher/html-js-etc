when to prefix/postfix, and when it doesn't matter:

If result of the increment/decrement is discarded, doesn't matter
let counter = 0;
counter++;
++counter; // counter now is 2

if we want to increase and immediately use, we use prefix:
let counter = 0;
alert(++counter); // 1

if we want to increase but use its prev value, use postfix:
let counter = 0;
alert(counter++); // returns 0, but counter is now 1
