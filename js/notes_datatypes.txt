JS is dynamically-typed, can re-assign an int to be a string
8 data types

1. Number -- both int and float
Specials: NaN, Infinity, -Infinity
Infinity is bigger than any other number, can get by dividing by 0

** Math operations will never fatally error, at worst get NaN

numbers are typically limited to 2^53 - 1
can use BigInt for bigger ones, by appending an "n" to the number.
const bigInt = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;

2. Strings
Double-quotes, single-quotes, and back-ticks (for additional functionality)
*** No "character" data type

3. Booleans
As expected. Can do like isItThough = 4 > 5; and isItThough is a bool (false)

4. null
- unlike other langs, not a "reference to non-existing object"
  nor a "null pointer"
Just a special value that represents "nothing", "empty", "value unknown"

5. undefined
Similar to null in that it stands apart, but this means a value has not been
assigned.
let age; alert(age); // shows "undefined", we haven't assigned a val to age

6. Objects and Symbols
All other types are "primitive" in that they can contain only one type of thing
Objects contain more complicated entities. Collections of data, etc.
"symbol" type is used to create identifiers for objects.
- Will be covered later

7. typeof
typeof returns type of argument -- good for processing different types
typeof 0 // "number"
typeof 10n // "bigint"
NOTE:
typeof null // "object" -- an officially recognized error in typeof
- Can also see typeof(x) but this is the same as "typeof x"
